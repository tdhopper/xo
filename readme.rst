xo: the text editor without frills
==================================
You might be looking for help, but this is all I can do::

    usage: xo [-h] path

    exofrills: your text has been edited...but you are still hungry.

    positional arguments:
      path        path to file, may include colon separated line and col numbers,
                  eg 'path/to/xo.py:10:42'

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Someone else made a `video tutorial <http://youtu.be/bPq8fncImtQ>`_ and posted
it on YouTube within an hour of the 0.1 release.
